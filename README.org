Core Lightning JSON-RPC client.

* Tests

You can run all the tests with:

#+BEGIN_SRC tms
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
$ make test
#+END_SRC

To install ~poetry~, see https://python-poetry.org.

Note that you only need to enter in the ~poetry~ shell (and install the
Python dependencies) once.

To test ~cln-client-clj~ against Core Lightning using ~pyln-testing~
library, run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC tms
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
$ make pytest
#+END_SRC

Again, ~poetry~ instructions are just issued once.

To test Clojure (no interaction with Core Lightning), run the
following:

#+BEGIN_SRC tms
$ make cljtest
#+END_SRC
